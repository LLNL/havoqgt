# Overview

HavoqGT (Highly Asynchronous Visitor Queue Graph Toolkit) is a framework for
expressing asynchronous vertex-centric graph algorithms.  It provides a visitor
interface, where actions are defined at an individual vertex level.
This code was developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

Built in C++, the framework provides a runtime for parallel communication and
algorithm termination detection.   V0.1 is an initial release with only MPI support.
All graph data is stored in mmaped files, using Boost.Interprocess and Memory 
Mapped (mmap) I/O.   Large graphs that cannot fit in main-memory may still be
processed using mmap as external memory.  For best results, high speed Flash 
devices are preferred for external memory storage.

# Getting Started

## Required to Build HavoqGT

- GCC 8.1 or later.
- CMake 2.6 or later.
- Boost C++ Libraries 1.64 or later (only headers required).
- Metall (https://github.com/LLNL/metall) 0.5 or later.

## Build
One can install Boost C++ Libraries and Metall using Spack.
A proper version of Boost C++ Libraries will be installed along with Metall.

An example to build HavoqGT with Spack is:
```bash
spack install metall
spack load metall
git clone https://github.com/LLNL/havoqgt.git
cd havoqgt
git checkout -b develop
mkdir build_dir
cd build_dir
cmake ../ \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++17 -lrt -lstdc++fs -lpthread" \
  -DHAVOQGT_BUILD_TEST=TRUE \
  -DMPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG="-n"
make
make test # option
make install # option
```

Use `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/g++` and `MPI_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/mpic++` CMake options to specify a C++ compiler and a MPI compiler, respectively.
To change the install directory, one can use `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` CMake option.


### Build without Spack

Here are the CMake variables to specify the locations of Boost C++ Libraries and Metall manually.
* `BOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost`
* `METALL_ROOT=/path/to/metall`

HavoqGT uses header files of the libraries. One does not need to build them.


## Build with Umap

To use Umap instead of system mmap(), use CMake option `-DUSE_UMAP=on`.

CMake tries to find the library from its default search paths.
To manually specify the location of Umap, use CMake variable `-DUMAP_ROOT=/path/to/umap/install/dir/root`.


## Build with HDF5

To build executable(s) that use HDF5, use CMake option `-DUSE_HDF5=ON`.
CMake tries to find the library from its default search paths ---
for instance, one can control the search path by using CMake variable `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`
We use HDF5 v1.10.7 for developing and testing.

### HDF5 on LC

```bash
module load gcc/8.3.1
spack install hdf5@1.10.7%gcc@8.3.1+cxx

# Spack sets HDF5's path in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH. 
spack load hdf5@1.10.7%gcc@8.3.1+cxx

# Here is another way
# Get a path to the installed HDF5 first 
spack find --path hdf5@1.10.7%gcc@8.3.1+cxx
# Then, set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH manually
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/hdf5:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}
```
