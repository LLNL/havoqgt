# C++ Examples using CLIPPy
This directory contains a series of examples of using CLIPPy for command
line configuration.   


**NOTE:** These examples are trivial and are used for illustration and testing 
purposes.  In no way are we advocating sorting strings externally to 
Python, for example.


## Examples

- [howdy.cpp](howdy.cpp):  Example of String input and output
- [sum.cpp](sum.cpp): Example of Number input and output
- [sort_edges.cpp](sort_edges.cpp): Example of VectorIntInt input and output, also contains optional Boolean.
- [sort_strings.cpp](sort_strings.cpp): Example of VectorStrings input and output, also contains optional Boolean.
- [grumpy.cpp](grumpy.cpp): Example of exception throwing in C++ backend.  Grumpy always throws a std::runtime_error()

## Building
Edit the `Makefile` as necessary and run `make`.
